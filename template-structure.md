Here's a brief explanation of what each directory and file is for:
    archetypes: This directory contains templates for creating new content files with specific front matter fields.
    config.toml: This file contains configuration settings for your site, such as the site title, author, and other site-specific settings.
    content: This directory contains your site's content, organized into subdirectories for different sections or content types. Each content file contains front matter (metadata) and the body content in Markdown format.
    data: This directory contains site data that is not tied to any specific content file, such as authors, menu items, or site-wide settings.
    layouts: This directory contains the templates used to render your site's content. It is organized by content type and provides the structure for how your content is displayed.
    static: This directory contains static files that are not processed by Hugo, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
    themes: This directory contains any themes that your site uses. Each theme has its own directory structure and provides templates and styles for rendering your site.
    public: This directory contains the final output of your Hugo site, generated by running the hugo command. It is typically served by a web server.

This is a basic overview of the directory structure for a Hugo site, and there may be additional files or directories depending on your specific needs and configurations.
